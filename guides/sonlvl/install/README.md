# SonLVL-RSDK Installation Guide

SonLVL-RSDK is a stage <!-- "multipurpose" or just "stage"? not sure --> editor for Retro Engine v3 and v4 games. This includes the mobile/Origins remakes of Sonic CD, Sonic 1, and Sonic 2.

TODO: talk more about the editor, give the guide some fluff

<!-- general steps:
	1. Download the editor
	2. Download proj files (no pic yet-)
	3. open the program
	4. select game project file
	5. select/make mod
	6. fill in mod info
	7. select level
	8. edit stage :D

todo: should probably mention something about Origins CD causing an error (thanks devs for having blank names..), either fix it in the editor itself or include a patched file or something here
