## SonLVL-RSDK: Getting Started

Welcome to the SonLVL-RSDK setup guide!
SonLVL-RSDK is a level editor designed for the Retro Engine versions of *Sonic 1*, *Sonic 2*, and *Sonic CD*, from editing existing levels to creating entirely brand new ones!
This guide will walk you through setting everything up and getting SonLVL-RSDK started for the first time.

### Step 1: Download SonLVL-RSDK

First, head over to the [SonLVL-RSDK releases page](https://github.com/Lavesiime/SonLVL-RSDK/releases) and download the latest version of the program. Once it's downloaded, just extract the files to any folder on your computer.

> **Warning:** Since SonLVL-RSDK works with multiple games, it’s best to keep it in its own folder. Don’t put it in the same folder as your game files - things can get a little messy that way!

</p>

### Step 2: Grab the Project Files for Your Game

Next, on the same page, grab the project files for the game you want to edit. For example, if you’re working with *Sonic 1*, download the `Sonic1.zip` file.

	<sup>The project files on the GitHub releases page. Pick the one that matches your game!<br></sup>

</p>

Extract the ZIP into the same folder as your game’s `.exe` file.

</p>

### Step 3: Open SonLVL-RSDK & Load Your Game

Now, open SonLVL-RSDK.exe. Drag and drop your game's SonLVL project file (included in the previous step) into the program window. For example, if you're working with *Sonic 1*, you would drag the `Sonic1-SonLVL.ini` file into the program (or `Sonic2-SonLVL.ini` for *Sonic 2*, or `SonicCD-SonLVL.ini` for *Sonic CD*, etc). Now your game should be loaded, and SonLVL-RSDK's icon and title should show that!

> **Warning:** Just make sure you’re dragging the *SonLVL.ini* file, not the *settings.ini* file  (which is part of the game files, not SonLVL's files, so you don't wanna use that one!)

<p align="center">
	<sup>Just drag it over, and then..<br></sup>

</p>

### Step 4: Create Your Mod

Using the top navigation bar, go to **File** > **Select Mod** > **New Mod...** to create a new mod. Fill out the form with your mod's details, and you’re good to go!

> **Tip:** For next time, you don't need to manually drag your SonLVL.ini file or anything! Instead, after opening SonLVL-RSDK, you can just go to **File** > **Recent Mods**, and select both your game and your mod in one click!

<p align="center">
	<sup>Now, create your mod..<br></sup>

</p>

### Step 5: Pick a Level & Start Editing!

Now, go to **File** > **Change Level...**, select a level, and edit to your heart's content!

<p align="center">
	<sup>Go ahead and choose!<br></sup>
