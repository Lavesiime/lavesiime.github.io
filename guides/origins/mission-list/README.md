# Mission Stage Map

In each game, all the missions are put into the "Bonus Stage" category of their respective GameConfigs. Each mission scene is set in a copy of the base version of the stage, meaning that all level data is completely separate. The same applies to the Boss Rush and DLC versions of each stage as well, with both of them also having their own, unique folders.

Lists are organised based on the order missions are listed in-game.
